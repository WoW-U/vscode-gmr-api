# GMR Lua API

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides Lua library definitions for **GMR**, enabling IntelliSense, autocompletion, and type checking for GMR-specific APIs.

## Features

- **GMR API Definitions**: Automatically adds GMR Lua definitions to the `Lua.workspace.library` setting.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with the [Lua extension by sumneko](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) to provide IntelliSense and type checking for GMR APIs.
- **Easy Setup**: Just install the extension, and it will configure everything for you.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "GMR Lua API".
4. Click **Install** to install the extension.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically add the GMR Lua definitions to your workspace. You can start using GMR APIs with full IntelliSense support.

### Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use GMR APIs with autocompletion and type checking:

```lua
---@type GMR
local gmr = ...

-- Use GMR APIs with IntelliSense support
gmr.AmmoExists() -- Autocompletion and type checking will work here
```
